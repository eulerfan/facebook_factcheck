## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Possible questions:

How do left, mainstream, and right categories of Facebook pages differ in the stories they share?

Which types of stories receive the most engagement from their Facebook followers? Are videos or links more effective for engagement?

Can you replicate BuzzFeed’s findings that “the least accurate pages generated some of the highest numbers of shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook”?

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
